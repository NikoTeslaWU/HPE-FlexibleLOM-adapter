# Ordering

Make sure to order this PCB with ENIG finish and beveled edges. Else contact
might be poor or your PCIe slots could be damaged.

# Assembly

The board requires just a stradle mount PCIe x8 connector to be fitted.
You can get it at LCSC: [C404097](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Card-Edge-Connectors_UMAX-3126-10102T_C404097.html)

# Mechanical mounting

This board has been designed to bring the front FlexibleLOM mounting hole as
close as possible to the PCIe bracket retention screw on a full size PCIe slot.
You can use a small angled metal piece or a even a 3d printed one to mount the
card into place.
