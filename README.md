# Ordering

Make sure to order this PCB with ENIG finish and beveled edges. Else contact
might be poor or your PCIe slots could be damaged.  
When ordering through JLC I'd recommend enabling the "Impedance" option and
sticking to the default JLC7628 stackup during ordering.

# Assembly

The board requires just a stradle mount PCIe x8 connector to be fitted.
You can get it at LCSC: [C404097](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Card-Edge-Connectors_UMAX-3126-10102T_C404097.html)

# Mechanical mounting

This board has been designed to bring the front FlexibleLOM mounting hole as
close as possible to the PCIe bracket retention screw on a full size PCIe slot.
You can use a small angled metal piece or a even a 3d printed one to mount the
card into place.
